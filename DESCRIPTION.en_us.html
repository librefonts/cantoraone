  Cantora ('Singer' in Spanish) is a friendly semi formal, semi condensed,&#13;semi sans serif.
It has reminiscences of hand lettering, mixing straight and&#13;bowed stems, and natural curves.

  It was born as an experiment in drawing from the outside to the inside&#13;(drawing the space surrounding the letters first, instead of drawing the&#13;letters themselves) in trying to apply the ideas and methods of Michael Harvey&#13;and Evert Bloemsma to my own glyphs construction.

  Although Cantora is a sans, the lowercase letters have serif proportions.
It's perfect for headlines (H1, H2, H3) in sizes larger than 20px.
